# Cybersecurity Home Lab

This repository is where I document my cybersecurity home lab projects. Iâ€™m building these labs as a way to practice real-world security concepts in a safe environment using virtual machines and other isolated setups. Each lab is written up step by step with commands, screenshots, and notes so I can learn and track my progress over time.
